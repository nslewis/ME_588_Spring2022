# ME 588 Spring 2022 Final Project
## Whack-A-Mole Game Description

In a game of Robotic Whack-A-Mole, you will be placing Mole-Whackers (foam balls or cubes) on
squares with Moles. The squares that Moles are occupying will be identified by color, with the field
having 3 different color squares (not including the starting square which will be white). At the start of
each game, a TA will tell you the color of the squares where Moles are hiding. Your robot must then
autonomously search the playing field for the Moles and place Mole-Whackers on those squares.

## Installation

Use FSM_Final.ino to run the robots. LineTestingTurning.ino helps debug turning when following the line. 

## Usage

Just upload the necessary code to the Arduino Board. Here an Arduino Mega Board was used.
